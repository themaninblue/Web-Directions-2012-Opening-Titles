			<h1>Web Directions South 2012 Opening Titles</h1>
			<p>These opening titles were written to be performed live on October 18, 2012. They included elements of live performance which you'll have to do yourself (by waving madly at your webcam) when you run this demo. If you'd like to see it as it was originally intended you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/53085539">watch a video of it here</a>.</p>
